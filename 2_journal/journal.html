through some interesting places on the way:

<li>Bountiful, UT,</li> 
<li>Last Chance, CO,</li> 
<li>Truth or Consequences,</li> 
<li>NM, Why, AZ</li> 
</ol>

"Passing cars, When you can't see, May get you, A glimpse, Of eternity."

My first day of the trip!  I can't believe I finally got
everything packed and ready to go.  Because I'm on a Segway,
I wasn't able to bring a whole lot with me: 
<ul>
<li>cellphone, </li>
<li>iPod, </li>
<li>digital camera,</li>
<li> and a protein bar</li>
</ul>
Just the essentials.  <q>As Lao Tzu would have said, "A journey of a thousand miles begins with one Segway."</q>
